# OPTIONS:
#   -f: start in foreground
#   -p <filename>: log the pid to a file (useful to kill it later)
#   -v: print version string and exit

# CONTROLLING STARTUP:
# 
# This script relies on few environment variables to determine startup
# behavior, those variables are:
#
#   CLASSPATH -- A Java classpath containing everything necessary to run.
#   JVM_OPTS -- Additional arguments to the JVM for heap size, etc
#   CASSANDRA_CONF -- Directory containing Cassandra configuration files.
#
# As a convenience, a fragment of shell is sourced in order to set one or
# more of these variables. This so-called `include' can be placed in a 
# number of locations and will be searched for in order. The lowest 
# priority search path is the same directory as the startup script, and
# since this is the location of the sample in the project tree, it should
# almost work Out Of The Box.
#
# Any serious use-case though will likely require customization of the
# include. For production installations, it is recommended that you copy
# the sample to one of /usr/share/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh,
# /usr/local/share/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh, or 
# /opt/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh and make your modifications there.
#
# Another option is to specify the full path to the include file in the
# environment. For example:
#
#   $ CASSANDRA_INCLUDE=/path/to/in.sh cassandra -p /var/run/cass.pid
#
# Note: This is particularly handy for running multiple instances on a 
# single installation, or for quick tests.
#
# Finally, developers and enthusiasts who frequently run from an SVN 
# checkout, and do not want to locally modify bin/cassandra.in.sh, can put
# a customized include file at ~/.cassandra.in.sh.
#
# If you would rather configure startup entirely from the environment, you
# can disable the include by exporting an empty CASSANDRA_INCLUDE, or by 
# ensuring that no include files exist in the aforementioned search list.
# Be aware that you will be entirely responsible for populating the needed
# environment variables.

# If an include wasn't specified in the environment, then search for one...
if [ "x$CASSANDRA_INCLUDE" = "x" ]; then
    # Locations (in order) to use when searching for an include file.
